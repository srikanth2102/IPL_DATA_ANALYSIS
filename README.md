# IPL_DATA_ANALYSIS
In this project we make use of SQL queries to get insights from IPL data. We make use of tableau software for data visualization.

## DATA
* The data used in project is taken from [kaggle_ipl_dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020).
* You can also find the data used [here](https://github.com/srikanth2102/IPL_DATA_ANALYSIS/tree/main/data).

## OVERVIEW
* In this project we perform Data Analysis and Data Visualization on IPL dataset to get valuable insights.
* Data Analysis is done using SQL and the results are saved as csv files and shared here.
* The queries written to perform Data Analysis is also shared under the directory Queries.
* Data Visualisation is done using Tableau.
* Tableau is an Data Visualization tool. Using Tableau is simple.
* Using Tableau you can visualize your data in a structured way that is easier to get insights from.
* To learn more about Tableau click [here](https://www.tableau.com/).

## OUTLINE FOR DATA ANALYSIS
* Under the file [IPL DATA ANALYSIS](https://github.com/srikanth2102/IPL_DATA_ANALYSIS/tree/main/IPL%20DATA%20ANALYSIS) you can the Data analysis part of this project.
* In that there will to two files name [IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020](https://github.com/srikanth2102/IPL_DATA_ANALYSIS/tree/main/IPL%20DATA%20ANALYSIS/IPL%20Ball-by-Ball%202008-2020) and [IPL Matches 2008 - 2020](https://github.com/srikanth2102/IPL_DATA_ANALYSIS/tree/main/IPL_DATA_VISUALIZATION). Under the qureries folder you can find the qureries written to retrive the data and the retrived data can be found as csv files under result csv files.

## OUTLINE FOR DATA VISUALIZATION
* Under the [IPL DATA VISUALIZATION](https://github.com/srikanth2102/IPL_DATA_ANALYSIS/tree/main/IPL_DATA_VISUALIZATION) you can find the plot and graphs plotted using the data retrived from data analysis (sql queries).
